A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2015"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"2"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"430","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"14"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"313"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"414"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"13"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"2"}]},{"numplayers":"2+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"315"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"128","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"27"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"62"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"33"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"58","results":{"result":[{"level":"1","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"53"},{"level":"2","value":"Some necessary text -

Driven by the ambition of their king, the Greeks have arrived on the shores of Troy. Some seek power, some seek revenge, while still others seek the great moment in battle that will define their place in history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Agamemnon is a fast-paced strategy board game in which two players take on the roles of ancient Greek gods during the Trojan War. By tactically deploying warriors to where they're needed across the board, each player may influence the final outcome of the battles famously detailed in Homer's Iliad. Some areas will be decided by the strength of the warriors, others by sheer weight of numbers, and some by the inspiration your heroes provide.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin the game, Strings of Fate tiles are placed on their matching spaces on the board, and each player receives one set of fifteen playing tiles. These tiles come in three varieties: Warriors, with a numerical value marking their strength, Leaders, with both a letter rank and a strength value, and Weavers who have no strength or rank, but instead manipulate the Strings of Fate. Each player will shuffle their tiles face down in front of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player flips over one of their tiles, and places it on any available space. If it&amp;rsquo;s a Weaver, its effect immediately comes into play: the Warp Weaver may swap two adjacent Strings of Fate, whilst the Weft Weaver simply splits all strings it&amp;rsquo;s connected to. After the first turn, each player flips and plays two tiles on their turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all the tiles have been placed, each string is resolved: each Strength String is won by the player with the highest combined strength contained within it; each Leadership String is won by the player with the single highest ranked tile within the string; and Force Strings are won by the player with the most tiles, including Weavers, in the string. Players claim all the tiles from Strings of Fate they have won, and the player with the most tiles at the end wins.&amp;#10;&amp;emsp;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2016"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"2"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"1","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"2+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"0","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"2","results":{"result":[{"level":"11","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"2"},{"level":"12","value":"Some necessary text -

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&amp;#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&amp;#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&amp;#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2007"},"minplayers":{"value":"1"},"maxplayers":{"value":"5"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"1723","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"66"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"737"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"344"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"316"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"947"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"156"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"867"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"589"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"27"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"991"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"480"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"30"}]},{"numplayers":"5","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"299"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"734"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"261"}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"9"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"21"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"637"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"521","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"11"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"51"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"122"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"188"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"114"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"24"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"2"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"669","results":{"result":[{"level":"16","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"1"},{"level":"17","value":"Some necessary text -

Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various Specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &amp;mdash; and both are in short supply.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs (unless, of course, it is averted!). The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2017"},"minplayers":{"value":"1"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world.

Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand &amp;mdash; and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2016"},"minplayers":{"value":"1"},"maxplayers":{"value":"2"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Villager Tool tokens&amp;#10;     Lost

Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &amp;ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &amp;ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&amp;quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &amp;quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &amp;ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &amp;ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &amp;quot;gateway game&amp;quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is

skill and dexterity to master this fast-paced game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One player (the Overseer) marshals an army of monsters while the others choose from six brave heroes who embark on a quest to save the town of Stormtryne from the threat lurking in the catacombs below. As the heroes explore, they must use their abilities, buy items, and recruit allies to help them defeat the monsters before facing the powerful Catacomb Lord, thereby saving the town.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, in Catacombs players flick wooden discs that represent the monsters and heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, while missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This third edition of Catacombs has all-new artwork compared to the earlier editions, but more importantly the keywords from the first two editions has been replace with iconography, the terminology has changed, and the third edition has new shot types, new card effects, and a different set of components (many of which have changed statistics) as well as wall pieces not present in earlier

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&amp;mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&amp;mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&amp;mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"1995"},"minplayers":{"value":"3"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

from four major powers of the world have discovered new lands, with new resources and opportunities. Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians and Japanese all at once move there to expand the boundaries of their empires. They build new buildings to strengthen their economy, they found mines and fields to gather resources, and they build barracks and training grounds to train soldiers. Soon after they discover that this land is far too small for everybody, then the war begins...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Imperial Settlers is a card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The core mechanism of Imperial Settlers is based on concepts from the author's card game 51st

To start the game, each player chooses one of two contract cards dealt to them; these contracts require players to collect icons of a particular color or groups of like-colored icons or icons and company tokens of differing colors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then take turns drafting cards from three face-up rows; the card on the end of each row costs nothing, the card in the middle costs $1, and the card closest to each of the three decks costs $2. Players start with no money, however, and the only way to get some is to draft it &amp;ndash; but naturally that means you'll be forgoing other cards. If a player has train cars matching one of the three face-up objective cards, he can choose to discard those train cars and claim the objective &amp;ndash; and since the objectives have the icons that satisfy contracts, you'll probably want to do that.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to train cars and money, players can draft characters, taking the special action of a character when he drafts one. Actions include things like taking a train car of your choice from the card array, stealing all money from one player, and taking a company token of the color of your choice.

In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.

description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is 1926, and the museum's extensive collection of exotic curios and occult artifacts poses a threat to the barriers between our world and the elder evils lurking between dimensions. Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2011"},"minplayers":{"value":"1"},"maxplayers":{"value":"8"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard &amp;quot;worker placement&amp;quot; genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place &amp;ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2014"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"499","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"41"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"222"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"227"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"177"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"41"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"170"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"226"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"10"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"144"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"206"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"61"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"5"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"212"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"71","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"25"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"30"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"12"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"75","results":{"result":[{"level":"136","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"53"},{"level":"137","value":"Some necessary text -

Elementary College has been slightly disappointing. They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you've spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn't help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors' warnings. When you slowly lift the cover of the terrible book, dozens of dreadful creatures rush out, threatening to destroy the world itself! This was your mistake, and only you can fix it now! Learn from the library to fight back against the monsters, and try not to sink into insanity...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Big Book of Madness is a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they've just freed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. &amp;mdash; but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you manage to turn six pages and defeat all of the monsters, you win the

However, the &amp;quot;Great Western Trail&amp;quot; not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2016"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"370","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"18"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"170"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"63"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"223"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"22"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"233"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"87"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"2"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"86"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"163"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"53"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"151"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"73","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"9"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"32"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"29"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"22","results":{"result":[{"level":"156","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"20"},{"level":"157","value":"Some necessary text -

You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent's score (called health) to zero, you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiple expansions are available for Hero Realms that allow players to start as a particular character

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&amp;#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the publisher's website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2010"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"356","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"13"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"143"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"118"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"59"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"220"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"25"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"107"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"189"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"1"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"235"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"68"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"4"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"15"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"167"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"234","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"7"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"11"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"84"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"111"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"16"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"98","results":{"result":[{"level":"171","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"13"},{"level":"172","value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":"82"},{"level":"173","value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":"3"},{"level":"174","value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"175","value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":"0"}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":"30"},"minplaytime":{"value":"30"},"maxplaytime":{"value":"30"},"minage":{"value":"10"},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":"1022","value":"Adventure"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":"1010","value":"Fantasy"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2001","value":"Action Point Allowance System"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2023","value":"Cooperative Play"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2676","value":"Grid Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2040","value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2011","value":"Modular Board"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2007","value":"Pick-up and Deliver"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2004","value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2015","value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":"39723","value":"Forbidden Games"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":"6485","value":"Mensa Select"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":"169390","value":"La Isla Prohibida: La Expansión Prohibida"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":"136063","value":"Forbidden Desert"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":"378","value":"Matt Leacock"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":"34356","value":"C.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&amp;#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &amp;quot;colleagues&amp;quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &amp;quot;good old days,&amp;quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &amp;quot;holds&amp;quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &amp;quot;captain,&amp;quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; and which to the &amp;quot;night.&amp;quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; - and one on the right (&amp;quot;night&amp;quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &amp;quot;combat&amp;quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &amp;quot;gunpowder&amp;quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns.

series. The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2&amp;ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special &amp;quot;handshakes&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;HS&amp;quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good &amp;quot;couples&amp;quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &amp;times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, &amp;times;2 for the multiplier.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"1999"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"2"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"277","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"205"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"258"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"17"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"2"}]},{"numplayers":"2+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"5"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"183"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"104","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"15"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"64"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"21"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"113","results":{"result":[{"level":"216","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"113"},{"level":"217","value":"Some necessary text -

In addition to controlling a hero, the player has spells at his disposal with which he can alter the very structure of the castle.&amp;#10;In a Magus turn, a player can perform up to 2 normal actions (move, attack, play spells, among others) and any number of quick actions (use knowledge, advance missions, use relics, etc.) Each action has a cost that must be paid with energy from one of the two existing wells: Well of power (Green) and Well of control (purple). As the game progresses players will gain energy that they can freely assign to their power or control reserve as needed for one or the other action.&amp;#10;The Magus main play mode is competitive, each player will try to reach before the rest to the 10 dominion points using his hero and his spells to delay the advance of enemies. But there is also the cooperative mode, in which players must defeat the powerful archmage Ardeth. For this they must travel the castle accomplishing different objectives that reduce the dominion of the archmage before he arrives at the castle for the final combat.&amp;#10;In cooperative mode, the Dominion points are the way of measuring Ardeth's strength, which players must reduce as much as possible whilst preparing for his arrival. When the archmage appears in the castle players must face him, and the life of Ardeth will be determined by the dominion gained at the moment of his appearance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magus: Aura Mortis es una reimplementaci&amp;oacute;n de Magus: &amp;quot;Fortuna et nostis&amp;quot;.

Cada acci&amp;oacute;n tiene un costo que debe ser pagado siempre fichas de energ&amp;iacute;a de alguno de los dos tipos existentes.

Pero tambi&amp;eacute;n existe el modo cooperativo, aqu&amp;iacute; los jugadores deben derrotar al poderoso archimago Ardeth. Para ello deben recorrer el castillo cumpliendo distintos objetivos que reduzcan el dominio del archimago antes de que este llegue al castillo para el combate final. &amp;#10;En el modo cooperativo los puntos de dominio miden la fuerza de Ardeth, y los jugadores deben reducirlo lo mas posible mientras se preparan para su llegada. Cuando el archimago aparece en el castillo deben enfrentarlo, y la vida de Ardeth estar&amp;aacute; determinada por la dominio acumulado al momento de su aparici&amp;oacute;n.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2017"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"5"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"4","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"3"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"5","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"1"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"2","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"1","results":{"result":[{"level":"226","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"227","value":"Some necessary text -

Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Admit it. You love it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Other&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&amp;eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &amp;quot;bad stuff&amp;quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &amp;quot;big announcement.&amp;quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Sequels:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&amp;#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&amp;#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&amp;#10;    Munchkin Bites!&amp;#10;    Munchkin Booty&amp;#10;    Munchkin Conan&amp;#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&amp;#10;    Munchkin Fu&amp;#10;    Munchkin Impossible&amp;#10;    Munchkin Legends&amp;#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&amp;#10;    Munchkin Zombies&amp;#10;    Star Munchkin&amp;#10;    Super Munchkin&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Related Board Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Munchkin Quest&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Online play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

Narodów"}],"description":"From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nations is an intense historical board game for 1&amp;ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay introduction&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Buy a card&amp;#10;     Deploy a worker&amp;#10;     Hire an architect for a wonder&amp;#10;     Special action provided by a card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored.

The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &amp;quot;Schwarze Kapelle&amp;quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &amp;mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &amp;quot;Conspire&amp;quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp;amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &amp;quot;Target&amp;quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &amp;quot;Eagles&amp;quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2016"},"minplayers":{"value":"1"},"maxplayers":{"value":"5"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"37","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"15"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"7"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"26"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"16"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"7"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"2"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"7"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"13"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"4"}]},{"numplayers":"5","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"15"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"9"}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"13"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"11","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"7"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"4","results":{"result":[{"level":"256","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"257","value":"Some necessary text -

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &amp;mdash; the currency/points in the game &amp;mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &amp;quot;button income&amp;quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board.

Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

The goal for both players is to ensure that when the hand ends, the playing field has cards of these colors and these colors only.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, the detective draws as many cards as he wishes from the shuffled deck, putting them on the playing field according to the marks on the cards. The deck also contains ravens, which when drawn will &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; any discarded cards of that color and threaten to take them out of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the detective player is done, the Ren player picks one of the cards in the playing field and puts on the leftmost still &amp;quot;incomplete&amp;quot; hidden card. A hidden card is complete when that card plus the cards placed on it total 7. (The fourth pile, however, should total only 5, according to the Japanese poem metric &amp;quot;dodoitsu&amp;quot; that goes 7-7-7-5.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all four hidden cards are completed, the round ends and unless the playing field has exactly the colors represented among the hidden cards, the players have failed. The game is played for three hands, but in the final hand, one hidden card must be completed per round, lest the players fail. Players also fail if the deck runs out or if all five Ravens are drawn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2013"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"2"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"19","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"17"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"19"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"2+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"16"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"5","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"8","results":{"result":[{"level":"281","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"1"},{"level":"282","value":"Some necessary text -

This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and &amp;ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work &amp;ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is an epic game from Portal.

A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &amp;ldquo;The Factory&amp;rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&amp;rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &amp;ldquo;encounter&amp;rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2016"},"minplayers":{"value":"1"},"maxplayers":{"value":"5"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

(Tarot Storia) is a game for one player playing solitaire or for two players playing co-operatively. The game is published in a Japanese / English edition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, the player starts with one hand card, then draws a second. From these two, they play a card to the tableau. Cards are played touching, in columns left or right but shifted halfway up or down. In the one-player game, a column is restricted to 4 cards, in the two player, the limit is 3 cards. Alternately, you may exchange a played card with a hand card. But next turn, after drawing, you must play down two cards so your hand is back down to one before drawing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all the cards are played, cards are turned face-down if any card on its right is of a lower number. Then the player tries to find paths in the tableau from the far left to the far right side. Think of this as telling the story. Any cards that are not part of a valid path are also turned down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now you score for colour groups, and deduct points for face-down cards and gaps in the tableau. After keeping a column, shuffle the deck over and play a second round to get your final score and the King's opinion!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For two players, it's the same--with both players working a hand of two cards each. You cannot consult about which card to play, but after choosing, you may confer about placing. The final score this time reflects a test of your friendship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Publisher's summary:&amp;#10;&amp;quot;You shall be rewarded if your tale amuses me.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The eccentric king issued the edict to all over the country. You are a bard who is willing to take up that challenge. You have to make up a tale by mixing stories in the world and enchant the king with the tale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With 22 beautifully illustrated tarot cards with four background colours, this card game demands you make a succession of tough decisions. You will be excited to see how the storyline barely keeps consistency.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Basically, you play a card from two cards in your hand each turn. When you have played all cards, the first round ends and you score according to the card positions. With some of these cards remaining in play, the game proceeds to the second round in the same way. The total of two rounds is your final score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Publisher's summary:

memorable empires. Over the course of the game, players will expand their domains, gain new technologies, and build many of humanity's greatest wonders. In the end, one nation will rise above all others to leave its indelible mark upon history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This new game presents players with an undiscovered country to conquer, built from beautifully illustrated map tiles. These would-be conquerors construct and populate the map with barbarians, natural resources, and city-states, then formulate their plans for how they will shape this world to their vision. Their exact goals, however, change with each game. Agendas are detailed on victory cards, three of which are drawn during set up. Players race to become the first to accomplish one agenda on each of these victory cards, spreading throughout the world and ensuring their civilization&amp;rsquo;s place as the greatest world power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2017"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"35","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"11"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"5"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"13"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"7"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"7"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"20"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"23"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"6"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"9"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"9","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"3","results":{"result":[{"level":"326","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"327","value":"Some necessary text -

It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios. Also, in the newest version, there are new ways to play that allow up to 6 players with modes like Boss, Hunter, and Free for All. You can also add Star Realms Colony Wars to the deck to make it 4 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Factions&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Trade Federation&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&amp;rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&amp;rsquo;s trade and other interests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;The Blobs&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &amp;ldquo;The Blobs&amp;rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Star Empire&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Machine Cult&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Playing Star Realms&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#139;When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&amp;rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Authority directly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&amp;rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&amp;rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&amp;rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&amp;rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2014"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"2"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&amp;#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2016"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"296","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"193"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"277"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"16"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"1"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"48"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"163"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"13"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"102"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"114"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"172"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"72","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"13"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"25"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"26"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"26","results":{"result":[{"level":"336","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"337","value":"Some necessary text -

ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reimplemented by Star Wars: X-Wing (Second

And once you've eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you've got! But be careful which sushi you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sushi Go! takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of &amp;quot;draft and pass&amp;quot; are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2013"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"5"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"236","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"146"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"10"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"96"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"93"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"67"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"126"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"4"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"157"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"50"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"1"}]},{"numplayers":"5","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"63"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"102"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"10"}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"17"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"97"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"83","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"11"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"48"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"22"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"52","results":{"result":[{"level":"1","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"31"},{"level":"2","value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":"21"},{"level":"3","value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"4","value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"5","value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":"0"}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":"15"},"minplaytime":{"value":"15"},"maxplaytime":{"value":"15"},"minage":{"value":"8"},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":"1002","value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2041","value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2040","value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2004","value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2020","value":"Simultaneous Action Selection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":"16972","value":"Crowdfunding: Indiegogo"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":"5841","value":"Food / Cooking"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":"44820","value":"Sushi Go!"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":"186885","value":"Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte Sonderdrucke 2015"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":"165802","value":"Sushi Go!: Soy Sauce Promo"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":"192291","value":"Sushi Go Party!"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":"8347","value":"Phil Walker-Harding"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":"79989","value":"Nan Rangsima"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":"40000","value":"Tobias Schweiger"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":"8347","value":"Phil Walker-Harding"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":"6567","value":"Adventureland Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":"23043","value":"ADC Blackfire Entertainment"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":"18856","value":"AURUM, Inc."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":"2691","value":"Cocktail Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":"2366","value":"Devir"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":"19047","value":"FoxMind Israel"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":"108","value":"Gamewright"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":"30940","value":"Hemz Universal Games Co.

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &amp;quot;decksploration&amp;quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &amp;quot;role&amp;quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &amp;quot;run&amp;quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&amp;rsquo;s obstacles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &amp;mdash; Asylum &amp;mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Official FAQ&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Expansions were published in this order:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Asylum (base game) (2015)&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) &amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) &amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147;

Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&amp;#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2006"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"161","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"74"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"85"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"51"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"13"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"55"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"73"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"10"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"44"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"78"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"14"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"60"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"23","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"5"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"12"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"5"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"49","results":{"result":[{"level":"376","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"49"},{"level":"377","value":"Some necessary text -

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&amp;#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&amp;#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&amp;#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2016"},"minplayers":{"value":"1"},"maxplayers":{"value":"5"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2015"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"350","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"5"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"193"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"88"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"206"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"22"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"239"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"71"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"7"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"43"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"167"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"87"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"184"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"72","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"12"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"43"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"9"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"2"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"47","results":{"result":[{"level":"391","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"392","value":"Some necessary text -

If they don't get back to the sub before they run out of air, they'll drop all their treasure. Now it's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Objective&amp;#10;The game takes place over 3 rounds, and the player to gain the most points over the 3 rounds is the winner.

You cannot return to the submarine without bringing any ruins chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turn Progression&amp;#10;On their turns, players conduct steps 1-4 listed below.

Players control a home galaxy and a fleet of space ships. As players upgrade their galaxies, they gain access to more ships and more dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, a player rolls a set of dice; how many dice are rolled is determined by the level of that player's galaxy.

Each die, in order, is then resolved and the results are immediate, which allows the player to pull-off unseen combos and surprise other players. Other players have the option to copy other player's actions...at a cost!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As players expand their galaxy by colonizing other planets through economic and diplomatic influence, they gain victory points AND the special powers brought in by those planets!

Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk &amp;mdash; and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests &amp;mdash; or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit.

The colors correspond to different question categories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &amp;quot;pie spaces&amp;quot;, and from these there are &amp;quot;spokes&amp;quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the

Kennedy&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &amp;quot;superpowers&amp;quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components (original edition):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

Everyone has only one goal in mind &amp;ndash; to be celebrated as the winner and the newest member of the legendary guild.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dale of Merchants, players take the roles of those participating merchants learning new techniques, trading goods, and managing their stock. The player who first manages to complete their astounding merchant stall wins the game and gets access to the guild!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2015"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"45","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"26"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"28"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"8"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"2"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"20"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"19"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"1"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"10"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"17"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"7"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"23"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"13","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"6"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"6"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"14","results":{"result":[{"level":"436","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"437","value":"Some necessary text -

In that time, the cave under which it slumbered has changed greatly&amp;hellip;Goblins and strange monsters have filled its gloomy depths and there are whispers that the cave itself has begun thinking, shifting, and growing evermore dangerous.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Still, stories of peril rarely overshadow the rumors of riches. And riches there may be&amp;hellip; For where a dragon slumbers, there also lies a fiercely guarded treasure. Fortunately for the slumbering beast, malevolent crystals fill the cave&amp;rsquo;s rooms with spectral light, hiding the entrance to the immeasurable treasure trove. Many have given their lives to the search and over the years the rumors have faded to legend.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But the most courageous adventurers will not be discouraged by bloodshed. On this day, a knight steps into the darkness, her gloved hand gripping the hilt of her sword. Her years of quests--all of the victories and defeats--have led to this one final adventure. Knowing the kingdom can never truly be at peace with the dragon beneath the cave, she has come to make a final stand. Little does she know that she will awake everything that slumbers in the shadows&amp;hellip; and begin the final battle in the darkness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Enter the world of Vast: The Crystal Caverns!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vast takes you and your friends into the torch light of a classic cave-crawling adventure, built on the concept of total asymmetry. Gone are days of the merry band of travelers fighting off evil. In Vast, you will become part of a new legend...

Each role has its own powers, pieces, and paths to victory...and there can be only one winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the ultimate asymmetric board game, Vast: The Crystal Caverns provides a limitless adventure, playable again and again as you and your friends explore the four different roles in different combinations.

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Viticulture - Essential Edition comes with components for Viticulture, but adds some of the expansions from Tuscany, including 36 Mama &amp;amp; Papa cards, Field cards (previously known as &amp;quot;Properties&amp;quot;), expanded/revised Visitors, and 24 Automa cards (solo variant), along with a couple of minor rule changes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Card Totals&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Viticulture Essential Edition contains 154 cards at the 44 x 67 mm size and 88 cards at the 63 x 88 mm size.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2015"},"minplayers":{"value":"1"},"maxplayers":{"value":"6"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"207","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"13"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"103"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"20"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"35"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"113"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"12"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"89"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"59"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"3"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"122"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"40"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"2"}]},{"numplayers":"5","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"30"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"83"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"15"}]},{"numplayers":"6","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"5"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"77"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"48"}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"90"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"45","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"9"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"24"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"9"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"21","results":{"result":[{"level":"446","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"447","value":"Some necessary text -

Plan your moves well - it will take strategy and a little luck to win the battle for Vye!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vye is a strategy card game played by 2-5 players.

But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of &amp;quot;train robbing,&amp;quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards.  All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored.  Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between.  A player's turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets.  Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called &amp;quot;Train robbing.&amp;quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.  The player scoring the most total points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2008"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"89","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"34"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"13"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"36"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"19"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"35"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"39"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"1"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"19"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"38"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"11"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"31"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"17","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"3"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"11"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"28","results":{"result":[{"level":"456","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"25"},{"level":"457","value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":"3"},{"level":"458","value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"459","value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":"0"},{"level":"460","value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":"0"}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":"30"},"minplaytime":{"value":"30"},"maxplaytime":{"value":"30"},"minage":{"value":"8"},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":"1002","value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":"1034","value":"Trains"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2040","value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2047","value":"Memory"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":"2004","value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":"17","value":"Ticket to Ride"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":"9209","value":"Ticket to Ride","inbound":"true"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":"9","value":"Alan R.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box

&amp;quot;Stone Age&amp;quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;","yearpublished":{"value":"2008"},"minplayers":{"value":"2"},"maxplayers":{"value":"4"},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"765","results":[{"numplayers":"1","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"15"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"382"}]},{"numplayers":"2","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"143"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"381"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"107"}]},{"numplayers":"3","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"199"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"427"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"19"}]},{"numplayers":"4","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"484"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"185"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"23"}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":"4"},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"7"},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"303"}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"211","results":{"result":[{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"4","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"5","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"6","numvotes":"8"},{"value":"8","numvotes":"63"},{"value":"10","numvotes":"97"},{"value":"12","numvotes":"37"},{"value":"14","numvotes":"2"},{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"238","results":{"result":[{"level":"471","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"234"},{"level":"472","value":"Some necessary text -
